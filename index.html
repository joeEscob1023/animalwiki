					<h2>Penguins!</h2>
					<p>Penguins are a group of aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.</p>

					<p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, lives near the equator. Even though penguins look soft and fluffy, they can be very agressive so <strong>Watch out</strong>!</p>

						<h2>Spiders!</h2>
						<p>Spiders are a normal phobia for humans, but thankfully, alot of them can cause no harm, but a simple sipder bite. Spiders belong to the arachnid family, which means they have 8 legs such as scorpians. Spiders come in all shapes, sizes and colors. Some of them are very harmful while others cause no harm what so ever. A good thing to keep in mind is that, the more colors and shapes they have on their bodies, the more dangerous they are. Some spiders like tarantula are completely harmless and a bite from them will leave nothing more than your average spider bite. They are kept as house hold pets alot of the time as well.</p>

						<p>Before approching a spider, look at it's body and if it looks plain, chances are that its not going to harm you, but if it looks colorful and happy, just leave it alone and turn the other way!</p>

					<h2>Squirrels!</h2>
					<p>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots (including woodchucks), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia. The earliest known squirrels date from the Eocene period and are most closely related to the mountain beaver and to the dormouse among other living rodent families.</p>

					<p>Squirrels are very cute animals and my favorite to say the least. All they want to do is eat and have a good time. Plus they have alot of media coverage, check this <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/9/23/16354844/louisville-squirrel-on-football-field" target="_blank">video</a> out of a squirrel running a 42 yard touch down durig a college football game. Even the crowd cheers him on!</p>
